# Pygame-Snake-Game
Remember those snake games we used to play during our childhood. Let's relive those moments again ;) 
Just you need to do is install pygame and that's it
You're ready to go with the code attached
If you want the executable, all you need is get a pyinstaller, use: pip3 install pyinstaller
And then Move to the project directory and use: pyinstaller filename.py --onefile -w
Cheers!
